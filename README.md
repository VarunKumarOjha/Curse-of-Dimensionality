# Curse of Dimensionality
Curse of Dimensionality 
For any fixed n, the minimum and the maximum distance between a random reference point p and a list of n random data points p1,...,pn become indiscernible compared to the minimum distance. That is distance asymptotically becomes zero. The scale in this illustration is taken as log base 10. Therfore, y-axis will take negative values for high precision. For example, log10(0.000001) = -6.
